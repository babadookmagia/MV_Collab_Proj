Question


Can you get an oil change if your car overheats?
My car recently started overheating and noticed that it’s time for it to have an oil change. Can I get an oil change safely without the shop causing any damage if it overheats? Or in other words can I get an oil change if the car overheats? It hasn’t overheated in a while but if left on in idle for a period of time then it starts to overheat. 


Answer


solve the overheat problem first then do an Oil change and filter change


Answer


Yeah, it can happen. But you are not on the rack first. Others are there before you having their oil changed, so you got to wait your turn.  Meaning shut the engine off because it will over overheat.  Oil change guys do not like to change sizzling hot oil.(they do have skin they would like to keep)


There is no such thing as hydraulic fan system. It is mechanical(fan belt) or electric motor.
The original fan can last the life of the car(40+ years)Fan belt can break in 7 years.

You should work on your prioritizing skills. It's far more important to fix the overheat issue


Answer


Your wires are crossed!
That means you have bad logic.
A bad overheat can injure your engine quickly, causing expensive repairs.
You need to get the overhearing problem solved ASAP or don't drive the car.
There are different reasons for overheating.
The most common is a cooling system leak.  Is your coolant disappearing?
Next is a stuck/failed thermostat.
Non moving overheating is usually because of an electric radiator fan that doesn't work.
Can you tell us anything more about your overheating?

Answer


Yes, the car will be off while they change the oil.  While you're there, ask them why your car is overheating.

Question


Is it illegal to paint your car interior?
Hi there, I just bought a 2016 suburban with a black interior and I hate it. I want to paint it yellow. The seats. The dash. The steering wheel. Everything. My only issue is if it's legal or not.


Answer


Its legal.. Paint it whatever color you want it.


Answer


This question is illegal! You have the right to paint your own car!


Answer


Your car, do it if you want. However, you must be sur eyou want to keep it for a long time, becuae you will make it virtually unsaleable. I've only once been in a car with a yellow interior, (a Lambo at a track day). It looked awful although it was very dirty.


Answer


I'd hate to see where you live
